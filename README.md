This project uses PHP and SQLite to query a database and progromatically add content to webpages. This was built as an exercise following a treehouse course by Alena Holligan. 

To run this locally I'd recommend downloading the files and boot up MAMP. In MAMP start your servers adn go to phpMyAdmin then choose the import tab and select the downloaded database.sql file.
