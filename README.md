This project uses PHP and SQLite to query a relational database and progromatically add content to webpages. This was built as an exercise following a treehouse course by Alena Holligan. 

To run this locally I'd recommend downloading the files and booting up MAMP. In MAMP start your servers and go to phpMyAdmin then choose the import tab and select the downloaded database.sql file.
